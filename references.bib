  abstract  = {Dry ice is the solid form of carbon dioxide. It is used primarily as a cooling agent, but is also used in fog machines at theatres for dramatic effects. Its advantages include lower temperature than that of water ice and not leaving any residue (other than incidental frost from moisture in the atmosphere). It is useful for preserving frozen foods where mechanical cooling is unavailable.
Dry ice sublimates at 194.7 K (−78.5 °C; −109.2 °F) at Earth atmospheric pressure. This extreme cold makes the solid dangerous to handle without protection from frostbite injury. While generally not very toxic, the outgassing from it can cause hypercapnia (abnormally elevated carbon dioxide levels in the blood) due to buildup in confined locations.},

  abstract  = {Thermodynamic heat pump cycles or refrigeration cycles are the conceptual and mathematical models for heat pump, air conditioning and refrigeration systems. A heat pump is a mechanical system that allows for the transmission of heat from one location (the "source") at a lower temperature  to another location (the "sink" or "heat sink") at a higher temperature.  Thus a heat pump may be thought of as a "heater" if the objective is to warm the heat sink (as when warming the inside of a home on a cold day), or a "refrigerator" or “cooler” if the objective is to cool the heat source (as in the normal operation of a freezer). In either case, the operating principles are close. Heat is moved from a cold place to a warm place.},

  abstract  = {The coefficient of performance or {COP} (sometimes {CP} or {CoP}) of a heat pump, refrigerator or air conditioning system is a ratio of useful heating or cooling provided to work (energy) required. Higher {COPs} equate to higher efficiency, lower energy (power) consumption and thus lower operating costs. The {COP} usually exceeds 1, especially in heat pumps, because, instead of just converting work to heat (which, if 100\% efficient, would be a {COP} of 1), it pumps additional heat from a heat source to where the heat is required. Less work is required to move heat than for conversion into heat, and because of this, heat pumps, air conditioners and refigeration systems can be more than 100\% efficient. For complete systems, {COP} calculations should include energy consumption of all power consuming auxiliaries. {COP} is highly dependent on operating conditions, especially absolute temperature and relative temperature between sink and system, and is often graphed or averaged against expected conditions. Performance of Absorption refrigerator chillers is typically much lower, as they are not heat pumps relying on compression, but instead rely on chemical reactions driven by heat.},
